# ETF-Tracking-Error-Optimization-using-R-code

This post explains how to construct ETF tracking error (TE) minimization and introduce R packages which perform (sparse) index tracking. ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a traded fund listed on the exchange. ETF tries to mimic or follow a target benchmark index (BM) such as S&P500. This is called the tracking error (TE) minimization.

The R code is included in the attached .docx file to refer.
